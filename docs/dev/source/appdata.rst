Appdata Folder
==============

The GBI-Client use the appdata folder from the operating system to save the application data. In this directory the application creates a ``GeoBox`` folder including folders for the logs, the import- and export-data and the couchdb. 

Here you will find the the GeoBox directory::

        Windows: %APPDATA%/GeoBox
        Linux: ~/.config/geobox and
        Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/GeoBox


Windows
-------

Using Windows XP the application folder is hidden by default. You will find it at ``C:\Documents and Settings\<User Name>\Application Data\Roaming``.

On Windows 7 or Windows Vista you will find it at ``C:\Users\AppData\Roaming``
